Custom copy of the game Fishing Frenzy, which I developed for Rutgers COGS (Creation of Games Society). It is a two-person fishing battle, where the goal is to get a higher score than your opponent in 60 seconds.
<br>
<br>
The original game is between 2-4 players, each on a controller. The goal is to capture as many fish as you can before the clock runs out. I customized this version to be only two players, with keyboard controls.
